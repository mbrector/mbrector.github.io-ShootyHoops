Welcome to Shooty Hoops!

This is my first game that is played in the DOM. Simple game play consisting of a shoot button that kicks off each round and shoots for both players. I love using probabilities and numbers, so I have the accuracies of the players randomly generating and then being tested against Math.random to see if the shot is made or not. When the shots are taken the math is checked and the pictures change to show a hit or miss. The scoreboard also reflects each round results. First to 10 wins and prompts to let you know. You can then reset and play again! Thanks for playing.

This game works in your browser, just navigate to my github pages link.
