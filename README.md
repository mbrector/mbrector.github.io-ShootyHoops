Welcome to Shooty Hoops!

This is my first game that is played in the DOM, made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Simple game play consisting of a shoot button that kicks off each round and shoots for both players. I love using probabilities and numbers, so I have the accuracies of the players randomly generating and then being tested against Math.random to see if the shot is made or not. When the shots are taken the math is checked and the pictures change to show a hit or miss. The scoreboard also reflects each round results. First to 10 wins and prompts to let you know. You can then reset and play again! Thanks for playing.

This game works in your browser, just navigate to my github pages link: https://mbrector.github.io/mbrector.github.io-ShootyHoops/

I enjoyed the project and I am happy with how it turned out. I think I can apply the same logic to a baseball game one day and make a few innings long. I think this game does everything I wanted it to do and it is fun to play. If you have any suggestions please let me know!

I learned some really cool things on this project. I made custom buttons to look like basketballs and I liked that a lot. I manipulated my prompts with setTimeout to get my win condition prior to my prompts. I have my pictures changing within my Javascript to make it look animated. I moved some things around with pixels that I need to change to percentages to be more friendly in different size screens.

Would like to thank a few people for helping me with some code, testing, and troubleshooting: Tishana, Juman, Tony, and Stan.
